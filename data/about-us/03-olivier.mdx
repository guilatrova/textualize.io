After having mostly worked with PHP, JavaScript and ActionScript during the first 15 years of my career as a
Web developer, I had an epiphany while reading a blog post about modern Python - showing type hints,
type checking with MyPy, automatic formatting with Black, pytest, Pipenv... üòç  
I decided to switch my focus to Python, and after a few months of learning on Python, its ecosystem and Django
I was lucky enough to get a first Python job, as a Django/React lead developer for a young IoT startup.

A few years later here I am... Working full-time with Python (and a bit of TypeScript, my other favourite
programming language, for this website), being part with Will and Darren of building the future of TUIs... ‚ú®  
I still cannot believe it! üòÖ

I am really looking forward to see the apps people will build with Textual
once we will have fully implemented and documented the CSS machinery and the base widgets!

Outside of work I can usually be found bouldering, or running in Holyrood Park or... at the pub üçª
